			<h3>downloading</h3>
			<p>You can get the latest release at <a href="https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus/releases">my github releases page</a>.</p>
			<p>I try to release a new version every Wednesday by 8pm EST and write an accompanying post on <a href="http://hydrus.tumblr.com/">my tumblr</a> and a sticky on <a href="https://8ch.net/hydrus/index.html">my 8chan board</a>.</p>
			<h3>installing</h3>
			<p>for Windows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you want the easy solution, download the .exe installer. Run it, hit ok several times.</li>
				<li>If you know what you are doing and want a little more control, get the .zip. Don't extract it to Program Files unless you are willing to run it as administrator every time (it stores all its user data inside its own folder). You probably want something like D:\hydrus.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>for OS X:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you want the easy solution, get the .dmg app. Open it and check the readme inside.</li>
				<li>If you know what you are doing and want a little more control, get the .tag.gz. Extract it somewhere useful and create shortcuts to 'client' and 'server' as you like.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>for Linux:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Get the .tag.gz. Extract it somewhere useful and create shortcuts to 'client' and 'server' as you like. I build on Ubuntu, so if you run something else, compatibility is hit and miss.</li>
				<li>Or try <a href="wine.html">running the Windows version in wine</a>.</li>
				<li>If you use Arch Linux, you can check out the AUR package a user maintains <a href="https://aur4.archlinux.org/packages/hydrus/">here</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>from source:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you know Python, you can <a href="running_from_source.html">run from source</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Hydrus stores all its data&#x2014;options, files, subscriptions, <i>everything</i>&#x2014;entirely inside its own directory. You can extract it to a usb stick, move it from one place to another, have multiple installs for multiple purposes, wrap it all up inside a truecrypt volume, whatever you like. The .exe installer writes some unavoidable uninstall registry stuff to Windows, but the 'installed' client itself will run fine if you manually move it.</p>
			<h3>updating</h3>
			<p>You don't <i>have</i> to update every week, but I generally recommend it. If you leave it a while, updating multiple versions in a single step is usually fine, but I suggest skimming every intervening release post just in case there is an important update note in any of them (I usually <b>BOLD AND CAPITALISE</b> this sort of thing). If you run into an error doing a multiple update, try updating to every intervening version in turn (and please let me know, so I can fix the problem!).</p>
			<p>Clients and servers of different versions can usually connect to one another, but from time to time, I make a change to the network protocol, and you will get polite error messages if you try to connect to a newer server with an older client or <i>vice versa</i>. Read my release posts and judge for yourself what you want to do.</p>
			<p>The update process:<p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the client or server you want to update is running, close it!</li>
				<li>If you maintain a backup, run it now!</li>
				<li>If you use the installer, just download the new installer and run it. It should detect where the last install was and overwrite everything automatically.</li>
				<li>If you extract, then just extract the new version right on top of your current install and overwrite manually.</li>
				<li>Start your client or server. It may take a few minutes to update its database. I will say in the release post if it is likely to take longer.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Unless the update specifically disables or reconfigures something, all your files and tags and settings will be remembered after the update.</p>
			<h3 id="backing_up">backing up</h3>
			<p>You <i>do</i> backup, right? <i>Right</i>?</p>
			<p>I run a backup every week so that if my computer blows up or anything else awful happens, I'll at worst have lost a few days' work. Before I did this, I once lost an entire drive with tens of thousands of files, and it sucked. I encourage backups so you might avoid what I felt. ;_;</p>
			<p>I use <a href="http://www.abstractspoon.com/tdl_resources.html">ToDoList</a> to remind me of my jobs for the day, including backup tasks, and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freefilesync/">FreeFileSync</a> to actually mirror over to an external usb drive. I recommend both highly.</p>
			<p>By default, hydrus stores all your user data in one location, so backing up is simple:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><h3>the easy way - inside the client</h3></p>
					<p>Go <i>database->set up a database backup location</i> in the client. This will tell the client where you want your backup to be stored. A fresh, empty directory on a different drive is ideal.</p>
					<p>Once you have your location set up, you can thereafter hit <i>database->update database backup</i>. It will lock everything and mirror your files, showing its progress in a popup message. The first time you make this backup, it may take a little while (as it will have to fully copy your database and all its files), but after that, it will only have to copy new or altered files and should only ever take a couple of minutes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><h3>the powerful way - using an external program</h3></p>
					<p>If you are more comfortable copying directories around yourself, would like to integrate hydrus into a broader backup scheme you already run, or you are an advanced user with a complicated hydrus install that you have migrated across multiple drives, then you need to backup two things: the client*.db files and your client_files directory(ies). By default, they are all stored in install_dir/db. The .db files contain your settings and metadata like tags, while the client_files subdirs store your actual media and its thumbnails. If everything is still under install_dir/db, then it is usually easiest to just backup the whole install dir, keeping a function 'portable' copy of your install that you can restore no prob. Make sure you keep the .db files together--they are not interchangeable and mostly useless on their own!</p>
					<p>Shut the client down while you run the backup, obviously.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I recommend you always backup before you update, just in case there is a problem with my code that breaks your database. If that happens, please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>, describing the problem, and revert to the functioning older version. I'll get on any problems like that immediately.</p>
