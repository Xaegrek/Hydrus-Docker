			<h3>first off</h3>
			<p>I have purposely not pre-baked this into the client's install. You have to put it in yourself. The client won't connect anywhere until you tell it to.</p>

			<p>I run a public, objective tag repository that <a href="tagging_schema.html">you are welcome to contribute</a> to. I also run a read-only file repository that you can search and download from to get a feel for the interface. The files on my file repo are appropriately tagged in my tag repo.</p>

			<p>Here's the info so you can copy it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>public tag repository: 4a285629721ca442541ef2c15ea17d1f7f7578b0c3f4f5f2a05f8f0ab297786f@hydrus.no-ip.org:45871</li>
				<li>read-only file repository: 8f8a3685abc19e78a92ba61d84a0482b1cfac176fd853f46d93fe437a95e40a5@hydrus.no-ip.org:45872</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Tags are rich, cpu-intensive metadata. My repository has millions of mappings, and your client will eventually download and store them all. It will take a few hundred MB and some <i>hours</i> total processing time to fully synchronise. It will mostly happen in the background, without you noticing--for most users, it takes a week or more to quietly catch up. If you interrupt its processing maintenance, it will continue where it left off the next time it runs.</b></p>
